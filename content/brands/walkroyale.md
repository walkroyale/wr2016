The dreaded trip to the store. Did your heart drop? Mine used to. Seeing the same styles and limited choices we are offered used to make me sick. I dreaded it! Who in the world thought of the term, “husky” as the way to describe our section?

Am I the only person who feels like they take the remnant fabrics and patterns, throw them together, mark up the price and just say, “These big people can wear this!”

Our size does not mean we can’t be clean, hot, cutting edge, neat and well put together. That is the problem we are solving at Walk Royale. Between the three lines we have and the clothing soon to come, we want to offer a variety of clothing (and some tips) to fit every area of your life.

Between the three of us, we will lead the charge of being Big and Beautiful. We will help you look good on the inside and the outside. We will give you our tricks of the trade in fashion and in other areas.

We will help you walk like the Royalty you are.
